<h2> From cells to tissues </h2>
<p align= "justify">
During biology classes in high school most of the students get the chance to see the structure of onion tissue. The way that onion cells are connect to each other might lead to the wrong idea of how tissues are organised. Our body is made of different tissues, with different properties. Different cells form different tissues. However, not only cells are responsible for such differences. <b>Living tissues are more than packed cells.</b>

Like the cement that keeps bricks in a wall, cells use a complex meshwork of sugars, water, minerals and proteins to hold together as a tissue. This mixture fills up the space in-between the cells and is therefore designated by <b>extracellular matrix (ECM)</b>. Besides providing a structure support to the cells, the ECM plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, such as cell survival, development, adhesion and differentiation of stem cells.<br>
In my research I use <b>cutting edge microscopy to understand the role of physical forces in cellular behaviour</b>.
