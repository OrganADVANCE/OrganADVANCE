<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Visualization of the structure of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in living cells is important for the understanding of its function. Here we synthesized a library of BODIPY labeled 8 hydroxyquinoline derivatives and evaluated their spectroscopic properties, cytotoxicity, and intracellular localization. The compounds were easily obtained in 34 â€“ 80% yield. Based on the spectral properties and low cytotoxicity, we selected the quinolin-8-yl pentanoate derivative 17 for in vivo labeling of the ER. Fluorescence staining of the ER was evaluated by comparison with a commercial ER tracker. The molecules here developed are smaller than the alternatives commercially available while still presenting a high specificity towards the ER.
