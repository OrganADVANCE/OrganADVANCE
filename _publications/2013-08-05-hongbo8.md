<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
The gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Clâˆ’ channels is controlled by a complex interplay among [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, membrane potential and permeant anions. Besides Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup> also can activate both TMEM16A and TMEM16B. This study reports the effects of several divalent cations as regulators of TMEM16A channels stably expressed in HEK293T cells. Among the divalent cations that activate TMEM16A, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is most effective, followed by Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>, which have similar affinity, while Mg<sup>2+</sup> is ineffective. Zn<sup>2+</sup> does not activate TMEM16A but inhibits the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride currents. Maximally effective concentrations of Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> occluded activation of the TMEM16A current by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> all regulate the channel by the same mechanism.
